Developed a voice-based email service using Python, integrating speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies. 
The service allows users to send emails through voice commands, enhancing accessibility and user convenience. 

The key features include:
Speech Recognition: Utilized the speech_recognition library to capture and interpret voice inputs.
Text-to-Speech: Implemented the pyttsx3 library for verbal prompts and feedback.
Email Automation: Configured smtplib for sending emails via Gmail's SMTP server.
User Interaction: Included functions to greet users based on the time of day and prompt for email details like recipient, subject, and body through voice inputs.
Error Handling: Incorporated error handling for unrecognized voice inputs and email sending issues.

Please download all the libraries before executing the file and also replace your sender's email and the frequently contacted receipients.
